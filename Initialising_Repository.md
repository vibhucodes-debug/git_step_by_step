# INITIALISING A REPO IN VS CODE USING TERMINAL

> `git init`
  - Initialise an empty repo in the current folder

*Git creates a hidden folder called .git inside your project. This is where Git stores all the information it needs to track your files and history.*  

> `git status`
  - The `git status` command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area.

### Staging 

  *The staging environment (or staging area) is like a waiting room for your changes. We use it to tell git exactly which files to include in the next commit*

> `git add <filename>`
  - Add a file in the staging area.
    
> `git add --all` OR `git add -A`
  - Add all files to staging area.
>  `git restore --staged <filename>`
  - Remove a file from the staging area.
