# Basic steps in initialising a Repository


### Setting Up

> git config --global user.name "Vaibhav Sharma"

> git config --global user.email "vaibahvsharma2124@gmail.com"

> git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
  - Set the default code editor as VS Code.


### Initialising

  > `git init`
    - Initialise an empty repo in the current folder

*Git creates a hidden folder called .git inside your project. This is where Git stores all the information it needs to track your files and history.*  

  > `git status`
    - The `git status` command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area.

### Staging 

  *The staging environment (or staging area) is like a waiting room for your changes. We use it to tell git exactly which files to include in the next commit*

  > `git add <filename>`
    - Add a file in the staging area.
      
  > `git add --all` OR `git add -A`
    - Add all files to staging area.
  >  `git restore --staged <filename>`
    - Remove a file from the staging area.

### Commit 

  * A  `commit` is like a save point in our project. It records a snapshot of our files at a certain time, with a message describing what changed. We can always go back to a previous commit if we need.*


  > `git commit -m "messaging"`
    - Commit staged changes with a message.

  > `git commit -m -a "messaging"`
    - Commit all tracked files and, skipping staging.

  > `git log`
    - Display the commit history
    *Note: This commits all the modified, and deleted items, but not **the new tracked files**.


### Branching 

> `git branch new-branch`
  - To create a new branch.

> `git checkout new-branch`
  - To shift move on another branch.

*Any commits you make on this branch will be separate from the main branch and wonâ€™t affect it. This allows you to work on new features or bug fixes without disrupting the stability of the main branch.*

**Steps invovled in merging 'new-branch' to the 'main' branch:**

- `git checout main`
- `git merge new-branch`
